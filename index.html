                <p id="paragraph">My name is Morgan Maxwell and I am in the process of becoming a full stack developer. I live in the middle of Utah, am twenty-one, and have an amazing girlfriend of four years. My hobbies include sitting inside, watching movies, and trying not to throw up in shame at our current political climate. I love Dragon ball Z to a fault, play video games far too much for my own good, and have a hard time making it through a day without listening to a podcast or two.</p>

                <p id="paragraph2"> I am in the beginning stages of a six month coding bootcamp. It's a short, intensive course on the basic information required to code in the front-end and back-end. I am doing this as an alternative to traditional education.</p>

            </div>

            <p id="paragraph3">I hope to land a position in the back-end. I feel I will be competent in front-end work, but I have not found it very enjoyable so far. Using code libraries has been a godsend for that purpose, and I'm excited to see what else this course has to offer!</p>
